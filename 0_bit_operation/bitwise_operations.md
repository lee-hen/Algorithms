# Bitwise operations
- [ ] [Bits cheat sheet](bits-cheat-sheet.pdf) - you should know many of the powers of 2 from (2^1 to 2^16 and 2^32)
- [ ] Get a really good understanding of manipulating bits with: &, |, ^, ~, >>, <<

      - Shifting all of a number's bits to the left by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2. Thus, all of a number's bits to the left by n bits is equivalent to multiplying that number by 2^n.
      - Right shifts are equivalent to dividing a number by 2

        - CHECK IF EVEN
            ```python
              (x & 1) == 0
            ```
        - CHECK IF POWER OF TWO
            ```python
              (x & x-1) == 0
            ```
