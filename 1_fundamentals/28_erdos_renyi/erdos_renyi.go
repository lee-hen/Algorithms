package main

// 1.5.17 Random connections. Develop a UF client ErdosRenyi that takes an integer value N from the command line, generates random pairs of integers between 0 and N-1, calling connected() to determine if they are connected and then union() if not (as in our development client), looping until all sites are connected, and printing the number of connections generated. Package your program as a static method count() that takes N as argument and returns the number of connections and a main() that takes N from the command line, calls count(), and prints the returned value.
