// 2.1.23 Deck sort. Ask a few friends to sort a deck of cards (see EXERCISE 2.1.13). Observe them carefully and write down the method(s) that they use.

// 2.1.24 Insertion sort with sentinel. Develop an implementation of insertion sort that eliminates the j>0 test in the inner loop by first putting the smallest item into position. Use SortCompare to evaluate the effectiveness of doing so. Note: It is often possible to avoid an index-out-of-bounds test in this wayâ€”the element that enables the test to be eliminated is known as a sentinel.
