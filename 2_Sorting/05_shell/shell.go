// The study of the performance characteristics of ShellSort requires mathematical arguments that are beyond the scope of this book.
// If you want to be convinced, start by thinking about how you would prove the following fact: when an h-sorted array is k-sorted,
// it remains h-sorted. As for the performance of ALGORITHM 2.3,
// the most important result in the present context is the knowledge that the running time of ShellSort is not necessarily quadraticâ€”for example,
// it is known that the worst-case number of compares for ALGORITHM 2.3 is proportional to N3/2.
// That such a simple modification can break the quadratic-running-time barrier is quite interesting,
// as doing so is a prime goal for many algorithm design problems.
// No mathematical results are available about the average-case number of compares for ShellSort for randomly ordered input.
// Increment sequences have been devised that drive the asymptotic growth of the worst-case number of compares down to N4/3, N5/4, N6/5, . . .,
// but many of these results are primarily of academic interest because these functions are hard to distinguish
// from one another (and from a constant factor of N) for practical values of N.

// Property E. The number of compares used by ShellSort with the increments 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, . . .
// is bounded by a small multiple of N times the number of increments used.
// Evidence: Instrumenting ALGORITHM 2.3 to count compares and divide by the number of increments used is a straightforward exercise (see EXERCISE 2.1.12).
// Extensive experiments suggest that the average number of compares per increment might be N1/5, but it is quite difficult to discern the growth in that function unless N is huge.
// This property also seems to be rather insensitive to the input model.
