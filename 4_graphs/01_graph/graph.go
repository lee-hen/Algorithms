// Definition. A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. A simple path is one with no repeated vertices.
// A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices).
// The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.

// Definition. A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph.
// A graph that is not connected consists of a set of connected components, which are maximal connected subgraphs.

// Definition. A tree is an acyclic connected graph. A disjoint set of trees is called a forest.
// A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graphâ€™s vertices and is a single tree.
// A spanning forest of a graph is the union of spanning trees of its connected components.
