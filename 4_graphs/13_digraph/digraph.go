// Definition. A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges.
// Each directed edge connects an ordered pair of vertices.

// Definition. A directed path in a digraph is a sequence of vertices in which there is a (directed) edge pointing from each vertex in the sequence to its successor in the sequence.
// A directed cycle is a directed path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices).
// The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.

// Proposition D. DFS marks all the vertices in a digraph reachable from a given set of sources in time proportional to the sum of the outdegrees of the vertices marked.
// Proof: Same as PROPOSITION A on page 531.
